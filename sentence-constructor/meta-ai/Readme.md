## Done using llaMA-3

# Guideline Considerations that I found through prompting:

### Clear objectives: Define what you want to achieve.
### Structured prompts: Use structured formats and consistent formatting.
### Refine and iterate: Refine prompts based on LLaMA-3's responses.
After implimenting in a correction post prompt return, asking llaMA-3 why it went against the standing guidelines, and to clarify a return prompt to curve that issue from exhibiting itself going forward.
